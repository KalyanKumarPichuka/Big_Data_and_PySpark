    "The * selects all columns, so this returns the entire table named my_table.\n",

Spark's .filter() can accept any expression that could go in the WHEREclause of a SQL query (in this case, \"air_time > 120\"), as long as it is passed as a string. Notice that in this case, we do not reference the name of the table in the string -- as we wouldn't in the SQL request.\n",

    "#### Selecting\n",
    "The Spark variant of SQL's SELECT is the .select() method. This method takes multiple arguments - one for each column you want to select. These arguments can either be the column name as a string (one for each column) or a column object (using the df.colName syntax). When you pass a column object, you can perform operations like addition or subtraction on the column to change the data contained in it, much like inside .withColumn().\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between .select() and .withColumn() methods is that .select() returns only the columns you specify, while .withColumn() returns all the columns of the DataFrame in addition to the one you defined. It's often a good idea to drop columns you don't need at the beginning of an operation so that you're not dragging around extra data as you're wrangling. In this case, you would use .select() and not .withColumn().\n",

    "Another very common data operation is the join. Joins are a whole topic unto themselves, so in this course we'll just look at simple joins. If you'd like to learn more about joins, you can take a look here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A join will combine two different tables along a column that they share. This column is called the key. Examples of keys here include the tailnum and carrier columns from the flights table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that you want to know more information about the plane that flew a flight than just the tail number. This information isn't in the flights table because the same plane flies many different flights over the course of two years, so including this information in every row would result in a lot of duplication. To avoid this, you'd have a second table that has only one row for each plane and whose columns list all the information about the plane, including its tail number. You could call this table planes\n",
    "\n",
    "When you join the flights table to this table of airplane information, you're adding all the columns from the planes table to the flights table. To fill these columns with information, you'll look at the tail number from the flights table and find the matching one in the planes table, and then use that row to fill out all the new columns.\n",
    "\n",

    "####  Joining II\n",
    "In PySpark, joins are performed using the DataFrame method .join(). This method takes three arguments. The first is the second DataFrame that you want to join with the first one. The second argument, on, is the name of the key column(s) as a string. The names of the key column(s) must be the same in each table. The third argument, how, specifies the kind of join to perform. In this course we'll always use the value how=\"leftouter\".\n",

    "1. Examine the airports DataFrame by calling .show(). Note which key column will let you join airports to the flights table.\n",
    "1. Rename the faa column in airports to dest by re-assigning the result of airports.withColumnRenamed(\"faa\", \"dest\") to airports.\n",
    "1. Join the flights with the airports DataFrame on the dest column by calling the .join() method on flights. Save the result as flights_with_airports.\n",
    "    1. The first argument should be the other DataFrame, airports.\n",
    "    1. The argument on should be the key column.\n",
    "    1. The argument how should be \"leftouter\".\n",
